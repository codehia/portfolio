Senior software developer with 5+ years of experience building products that solve real problems. I'm product-minded—obsessed with shipping stable, well-crafted software at a pace that matters.

I thrive on learning new technologies, languages, and paradigms. Whether it's exploring a new framework or diving deep into systems programming, curiosity drives my craft.

My toolkit leans heavily into terminal-first, keyboard-driven workflows. I experiment with NixOS for reproducible environments, live in Neovim, and believe the fastest path between thought and code is through the keyboard. And yes, most of this happens with a cup of coffee nearby ☕

When I'm not coding, I'm probably tinkering—building something, breaking something, or figuring out how things work.
